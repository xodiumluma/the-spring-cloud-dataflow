= Spring Cloud Dataflow Aggregate Task Module

Spring Cloud Task and Spring Batch utilize a series of database tables to support storing data about Boot Application executions as well as Job executions.
For each major release of these projects, their database schemas  adjust to meet the needs for the latest release.
SCDF supports applications that may use the current release of these projects as well as a previous release.
The `spring-cloud-dataflow-aggregate-task` module provides support for dataflow to query and mutate data in each of the schema versions.

== Tests

The tests for this module are located in the `spring-cloud-dataflow-server` module
