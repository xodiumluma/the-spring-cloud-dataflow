== Getting Started - Kubernetes

This section covers how to get started with Spring Cloud Data Flow running locally on Kubernetes. See xref:configuration-carvel[Deployment using Carvel] and  xref:configuration-kubernetes[Configuration - Kubernetes] for more information on installing Spring Cloud Data Flow on Kubernetes.

Once you have the Data Flow server installed on Kubernetes, you probably want to get started with orchestrating the deployment of readily available pre-built applications into a coherent streaming or batch data pipelines. We have guides to help you get started with both link:https://dataflow.spring.io/docs/stream-developer-guides/[Stream] and link:https://dataflow.spring.io/docs/batch-developer-guides/[Batch] processing.

We have prepared scripts to simplify the process of creating a local Minikube or Kind cluster, or to use a remote cluster like GKE or TKG, more at xref:local-k8s-development[Configure Kubernetes for Local Development]
